        the features in the app. The thing is I am sure you are smart enough to figure everything on your own... so go on press skip, you can return to this section at any point anyways.</string>
    <string name="inputs_description">The clicky part of the telegraph is either your headphone button, or the build-in button.Press once to start write a letter for every bit you have a second, a press sets the current bit to 1.</string>
    <string name="bit_display_description">Displays the current bit sequence ,the symbol X means not written yet.</string>
    <string name="mail_box_description">This is the MailBox and this is where your message is been displayed..... that is it..... not rocket science</string>
